The Breadboard Setup:
- set up a button with an external battery that simply stops and starts a circuit
- the bb line that has A2 is supposed to be part of the circuit
- set up the mind wave reading circuit and put A0 in a bb line with it
- follow this article on how to connect the breadboard to the raspberry pi --> https://diyprojectslab.com/ads1115-16-bit-adc-with-raspberry-pi/

The ADS:
- using ADS1115
- the main function wire connects to A0
- the end button connects to A2

The Function:
- the function scans voltage every 0.1 seconds
- when the button is pressed, it opens the github repo and writes everything in userstuff/output.txt. it writes the voltage, and then the time (see userstuff/test_output.txt)
- whatever tf happens next idk charles u write here
